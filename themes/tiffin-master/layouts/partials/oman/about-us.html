                    TIFFIN MASTER founded by Mr. Mithran Shankar &
                    guided by team of experts who initiated the
                    successful Brand "Coffee n Recharge" - Chain of
                    coffee shops. In today's senario the failure in food
                    business is mostly because of human dependency.
                    Tiffin Master has created a system and the system
                    drives the business. <br /><br />
                    The concept was well appreciated by Mr. Jose Michel
                    Robin (JMR) - Founder and Managing Director of Oasis
                    Grace - 1000 Crore Empire in Construction Industry
                    in Oman, who came forward and invested the first
                    outlet in Oman - Muscat and followed by the second
                    outlet in Chennai. <br /><br />
